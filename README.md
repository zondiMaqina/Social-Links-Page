## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I can use margins sometimes to position small texts instead of resorting to flex to reduce effort

### Continued development

I will keep practising on how to position text well in terms of diffrent sizes
